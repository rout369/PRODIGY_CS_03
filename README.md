## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

    This tool is based on mathematical entropy calculations and estimation logic.
    🔸 Actual password security depends on many factors, including system vulnerabilities,
      password reuse, and attack vector.
    🔸 The crack times shown are only estimates and may be inaccurate or misleading
      in real-world scenarios.

    ✅ Always cross-check results using other professional password strength tools.
